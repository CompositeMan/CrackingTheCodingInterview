**diff_k:** <br>
Given an array of distinct integer values, count the number of pairs of integers that have difference k. For example, given an array [1,7,5,9,2,12,3] and the difference k=2, there are four pairs with difference 2 = { (1,3), (3,5), (5,7), (7,9) }.


**small_in_big:**<br>
Given a smaller strings and a bigger string b, design an algorithm to find all permutaÂ­ tions of the shorter string within the longer one.Print the location of each permutation.
```

s = abbc
b = cbabadcbbabbcbabaabccbabc

```
There are 7 such permutations.
